# null2264.github.io ([aap.my.id](https://aap.my.id))

Source code of my portofolio site.

## Goals
- Create a portofolio webpage with only pure HTML and pure CSS.
- Only use JavaScript for cosmetic, webpage should still work without it. (e.g. visitor use an extension to disable JavaScript entirely)
  - This is because CSS sometime act not the way you expect it to be, it is what is.
